## Welcome to my personal website!
I am currently a Research Assistant at the Bowdoin College Computer Science Department working on machine learning techniques applied to computational game theory. More generally, I love seeing how techniques from matrix analysis and geometry can deepen our understanding of machine learning techniques.
